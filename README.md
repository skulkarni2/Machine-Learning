# Machine-Learning
This Repository showcases the various machine learning methods learned during Applied Data Science and Machine Learning for Cities classes

The objective of this course is to familiarize students with modern machine learning techniques and demonstrate how they can be effectively applied to urban data. The course is practice-oriented: concepts and techniques are motivated and illustrated by applications to urban problems and datasets. For that reason, it involves a significant programming component, with Python as the primary programming language. Topics include a variety of supervised and unsupervised learning methods, such as support vector machines, clustering algorithms, ensemble learning, Bayesian networks, Gaussian processes, and anomaly detection. Strategies for effective machine learning and discussion of the limitations of ML as well as a variety of supplementary techniques are also considered.

The primary objectives of the course are to enable students to:
1) Understand the motivation behind different machine learning methods and their applicability in a given practical context.
2) Be able to implement methods adapted to the problem at hand using existing software libraries.
  
3) Know how to interpret the results appropriately.
